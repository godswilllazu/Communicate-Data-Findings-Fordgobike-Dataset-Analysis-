# Communicate Data Findings Project 


## by Azubuike Godswill


## Dataset: Ford Gobike System Data

Source: Amazon AWS

> This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in the year 2018.

Data Wrangling

> I cleaned the time columns(start_time and end_time) and with that cleaned the duration_sec column.

> I feature engineered some columns like: speed (in km/hr) ,dist (distance in km) and age to aid analysis of the data.

> Created visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn ,and Tableau (FordgoBike Data Analysis.png)




## Summary of Findings

* Most trips started on Tuesday and in the month of October in the afternoon.

* Most of the riders were males (73.5%) and females (24.9%).

* Most riders were between the ages of 25-35 years.
 
* Most trips were between 1 -2 km

* Male riders covered more distance than other genders. (72%)

* Subscribers had the highest total distance covered and time taken, 84% and 70% respectively.

* Mean speed of riders was approximately 10km/hr.

* Male riders had the highest mean speed of about 10km /hr , followed by the **other** (about 9.9km/hr) and then females (9.2km/hr)

* The elderly (70 -140 years)  took longer time to complete their journey.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I chose these findings over others because they are the insights most people would expect from such a dataset.
The size visualizations are increased and well polished than that of the exploratory analysis.
